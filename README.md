# JavaSimpleCalculator

## Overview
This Java-based calculator allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Users provide two numbers and select the desired operation.

## Features
- Supports four fundamental operations:
  - **Addition** (`num1 + num2`)
  - **Subtraction** (`num1 - num2`)
  - **Multiplication** (`num1 * num2`)
  - **Division** (`num1 / num2`, with division-by-zero protection)
- Uses Java's `Scanner` class for user input.
- Performs basic input validation for invalid operation choices.

## Installation & Usage
1. Clone or download the project.
2. Open the project in any Java IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ, VS Code, etc.).
3. Compile and run `Calculator.java`.
4. Enter two numbers when prompted.
5. Select an operation from the menu.
6. The program will compute and display the result.

## Example Run
Enter the first number 10 Enter the second number 5 Choose an operation (Addition)

## Dependencies
- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Any standard Java IDE (optional)

## Future Enhancements
- Support for advanced mathematical operations (exponents, square roots, modulus).
- GUI-based version for better user interaction.
- Error handling improvements for invalid numeric inputs.
